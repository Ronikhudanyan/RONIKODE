                Hi there! I am <strong>&nbsp;Roni Khudanyan</strong>
                <br />A passionate programmer, born and brought up in Los Angeles With Armenian roots and tech in my DNA.
                <br />
                I come from a long line of devs which have taught me tech from the moment I could speak, this in turn gave me a passion that cannot be taught.
                <br />
                My approach blends the passion I was brought up with and the 6 years of experience in the field.
                <br />
                My success comes from my ability to step back, take a look at the bigger picture and apply skills and experience. 
                <br />
                I am able to pick apart an issue to apply logic and critical thinking, which then delivers a product that is beyond expectations.
                <br/> 
                These traits combined directly contribute to the pride I hold with my work ethic.
                <br />I can get the job done in ways that will exceed expectations and set presidents for the future.
                <br /> <br />
